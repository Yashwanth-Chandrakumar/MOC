# CarbonControl: Carbon Footprint Management System

## Overview

**CarbonControl** is an advanced web application developed for the **Ministry of Coal** to manage, monitor, and neutralize their carbon footprint. Built with **Next.js**, the platform allows real-time ingestion of carbon emissions data, simulates potential future emissions, and provides actionable insights to help reduce the environmental impact. The application leverages powerful data analytics, visualizations, and reporting features to track emissions, simulate control measures, and optimize coal industry operations for a sustainable future.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Data Ingestion**: The app can ingest carbon emission data from servers, APIs, and sensors, updating the system in real-time.
- **Emission Simulation**: Simulate different scenarios based on variables like coal production, transportation, and environmental factors to forecast emissions and assess control strategies.
- **Emission Reduction Strategies**: Implement and evaluate various strategies for reducing emissions such as cleaner technologies, operational efficiency improvements, and energy consumption adjustments.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize emission data over time, including trends, forecasts, and detailed analysis.
- **Reporting**: Generate detailed reports on carbon emissions, potential reductions, and recommendations for mitigating environmental impact.
- **Sustainability Monitoring**: Track progress towards sustainable goals, measure carbon neutrality, and provide feedback on ongoing environmental initiatives.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building the server-rendered React application, enabling fast and SEO-friendly pages.
- **Node.js**: For handling backend logic and integrating with external APIs and data sources.
- **GraphQL/REST APIs**: For efficient data communication between frontend and backend.
- **Chart.js / D3.js**: For visualizing emission data through interactive charts and graphs.
- **MongoDB/PostgreSQL**: For storing historical emissions data, simulation results, and strategies.
- **AWS S3**: For storing large datasets and simulation results securely in the cloud.
- **Redux**: For state management, particularly in handling real-time data updates and user sessions.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application to ensure consistent deployments across environments.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous integration and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or CircleCI.

## Getting Started

To set up CarbonControl locally, follow the steps below to install and run the frontend and backend components.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL (for local database setup)
- AWS S3 bucket for storage (optional for large data handling)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carboncontrol.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd carboncontrol
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and configure the following:

   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/carboncontrol
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Open the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Backend (Optional)

If you want to set up the backend manually:

1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory (if separate):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

### Usage

1. **Ingest Data**: Use the dashboard to ingest real-time data from various sources such as sensors, databases, and APIs.
   - You can upload files or connect to external servers for continuous data syncing.
   
2. **Simulate Emissions**: Enter different operational parameters and let the app simulate the impact on emissions.
   - Adjust factors such as coal mining rates, transportation methods, and fuel types.
   
3. **Track and Reduce Emissions**: Evaluate strategies such as energy efficiency improvements, technological upgrades, and alternative fuel usage.
   - CarbonControl will help identify optimal strategies based on real-time and historical data.

4. **View Reports**: Generate detailed reports on your emissions status, reductions over time, and projected goals.
   - Share these reports with stakeholders for better decision-making and policy implementation.

5. **Monitor Sustainability Progress**: Track your progress towards achieving carbon neutrality or other sustainability targets.
   - CarbonControl helps you visualize progress with key metrics and milestone tracking.
